                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Started as a homework assignment for the Odin Project,
                    the Music Archive has become a pet project for me to practice
                    coding. I am hoping each Monthly Edition will help me visualize 
                    my progress in Html, CSS, & Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything here is my honest sardonic, sarcastic, and serious 
                    take on the music in my life.
                    I hope you can discover some groovy tunes and cool cats 
                    while you are here. I am always taking recommendations and fresh takes, but 
                    remember this screen can't prevent you from catching these hands. 
                </p>
                <h2>Why a Music Archive?</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy listening to music a little too much and I often find myself wanting to remember 
                    what I enjoyed in the past. I find the old adage "you are what you eat" applies to
                    my taste in artists, sounds, and genres. It's nice to reflect and recover gems from my past.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Is this a serious review of music? Absolutely not! More than anything else,
                    the Music Archive is a blog/journaling hybrid for me to play the historian before
                    I forget things.
